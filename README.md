# Rediscovering the Euclidean Algorithm  
*A Cognitive and Material Pathway to Recursive Division*

This repository contains the full LaTeX source and compiled PDF of an exploratory paper by Stephen Chong titled:

**‚ÄúRediscovering the Euclidean Algorithm: From Embodied Group-Splitting to Abstract Recursion‚Äù**

## üìú Overview

This paper proposes a speculative but historically grounded narrative for how the Euclidean algorithm may have emerged‚Äînot as an abstract mathematical invention, but as a tactile and visual response to the challenge of evenly splitting physical quantities. By framing division as a recursive process rooted in perception, regularity, and reuse of leftovers, the paper explores how ancient builders, stewards, or surveyors may have discovered recursive subdivision long before formalization.

It blends cognitive plausibility with historical context and mathematical structure.

## üìå Motivation

While no definitive records of the discovery process survive, this paper consolidates a set of **plausible strategies and intuitions**‚Äîrooted in manual group-splitting, perceptual imbalance, and recursive reuse‚Äîthat may have led to the Euclidean algorithm. It is intended not as a strict historical claim, but as a constructive, interdisciplinary narrative that blends:

- Early material practices (e.g., dividing grain, cutting rope)  
- Perceptual and cognitive behaviors (e.g., responding to leftovers)  
- Mathematical abstraction (e.g., efficient recursive procedures)  

## üéØ Who This Is For

- Historians of mathematics interested in cognitive or material origins  
- Educators exploring intuitive ways to introduce GCD and division  
- Mathematically curious readers who enjoy visual and tactile reasoning  
- Anyone who, like me, is curious about how ancient algorithms may have emerged from humble beginnings
